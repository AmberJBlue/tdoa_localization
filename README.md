## Time Delay of Arrival Localization

## Background Info

I wrote this code when I was working as a signals processing researcher at SF State University.  I get an email once a while asking about this algorithm so I'm making a github repo with better documentation around it.

## FAQ

#### What is TDOA Localization?

I wrote an expo paper about it here.

#### Where is the sample.wav file?

It can be any wav file that is mostly silence with a few bursts.  The best case is a recording of a gunshot (mostly silent with a big burst).  The worse case would be a recording of white noise throughout.
